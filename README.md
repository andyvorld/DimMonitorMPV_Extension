# DimMonitorMPV_Extension
Extension to be used with [mpv.net](https://github.com/stax76/mpv.net), that dims other monitors when the main mpv.net window is fullscreen.


Moving the mouse off mpv.net will undarken all monitors, until the mouse is returned to mpv.net.

## Installation
Copy the `DimMonitorMPVExtension.dll` file to `<mpv.net config folder>/extensions/DimMonitorMPVExtension`.
